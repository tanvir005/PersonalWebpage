                <h1>Develop <br> Without Limits</h1>
                <p>It is always best to learn about new technology and use it in my next project. We all know that we
                    can build a
                    responsive web application using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. But this doesnâ€™t mean that I
                    cannot use any
                    other libraries and frameworks for building responsive web applications. I can use other libraries
                    of JavaScript like
                    React, Angular to build a progressive web application. By trying out a new technology I place
                    myrself out of my
                    comfort zone which helps me grow and succeed more in my life as a developer.
